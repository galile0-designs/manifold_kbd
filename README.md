# make
BOM
16x M3x6 DIN912 screws
22x M3 heat set inserts, OD=4,5mm
1x Unified Daughterboard C Series
4x M2x6 DIN912 screws
4x M2 heat set inserts, OD=3,2mm
6x M3x12mm (or 16mm) DIN912 screws

I recommend printing all the parts solid infill. Hollow infill may cause the case to be excessively loud. The plate may be printed in a more flexible material such as PETG for improved sound.

The manifold is mounted as either a top mount or with 3D printed TPU pylons, picture attached

The top is a two piece design with a case that prints face down and a curved mantlet which is printed face up. The mantlet installs in the topcase with 6x M3x6 DIN912 screws.

manifold uses a USB daughterboard in the form of a Unified Daughterboard C-series, which screws into the bottom case. The heat set inserts here are best inserted mid print, as when finished, the case would get in the way of a soldering iron.
