# make
Hardware
16x M3x6 DIN912 screws
22x M3 heat set inserts, OD=4,5mm
1x Unified Daughterboard C Series
4x M2x6 DIN912 screws
4x M2 heat set inserts, OD=3,2mm, length < 4mm
6x M3x12mm (or 16mm) DIN912 screws
Switches and stabilizers
handwire controller

Depending on what controller board you use for the handwiring, you may have to fabricate a custom cable from your controller to the daughterboard. 
I recommend printing all the parts solid infill for acoustic reasons.

The manifold is mounted as a top mount with M3x6 screws, or alternatively using 3D printed TPU pylons in the other holes, pictures attached

The top is a two piece design with a case that prints face down and a curved mantlet which is printed face up. The mantlet installs in the topcase with 6x M3x6 DIN912 screws.

manifold uses a USB daughterboard in the form of a Unified Daughterboard C-series, which screws into the bottom case. The heat set inserts here are best inserted mid print, as when finished, the case would get in the way of a soldering iron.
